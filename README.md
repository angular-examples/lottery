## Lottery Simulator

Welcome to the example app used in the
[Lottery Simulator](https://webdev.dartlang.org/codelabs/angular_components) page
of [Dart for the web](https://webdev.dartlang.org).

In Dartium, you'll see the app right away. In other modern browsers,
you'll have to wait a bit while pub converts the app.
